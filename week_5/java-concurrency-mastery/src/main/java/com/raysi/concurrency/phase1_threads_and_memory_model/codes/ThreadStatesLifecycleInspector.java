 * 1. NEW
 * 2. RUNNABLE (Maps to both OS Ready and OS Running)
 * 3. BLOCKED (Waiting to acquire an intrinsic monitor lock)
 * 4. WAITING (Waiting indefinitely for notify(), join(), or LockSupport.park())
 * 5. TIMED_WAITING (Waiting with a timeout: sleep(), wait(ms), join(ms), parkNanos())
 * 6. TERMINATED (Completed execution)
