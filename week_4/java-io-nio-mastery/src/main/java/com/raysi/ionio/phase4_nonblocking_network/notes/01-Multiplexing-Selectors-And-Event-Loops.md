# 1. Architectural Purpose & Design Pattern

### What Exact Bottleneck in Previous I/O Approaches Does This Solve?
In early enterprise Java networking (JDK 1.0 to 1.3), servers followed the **Thread-Per-Connection (1:1)** architecture:
```java
// CLASSIC THREAD-PER-CONNECTION (THE C10K DISASTER):
ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(8080);
while (true) {
    Socket client = server.accept(); // Blocks until connection arrives
    new Thread(() -> handleClient(client)).start(); // Spawns dedicated OS Thread!
}
```
In this model, each client connection is assigned a dedicated operating system thread (`pthread`).  
When the client is idle (e.g. waiting for user keystrokes, keep-alive HTTP, or network latency), the thread blocks inside `socket.getInputStream().read()`.

**The C10K Problem (10,000 Concurrent Connections):**
1. **Thread Stack Memory Exhaustion:** Each OS thread allocates a default 1 MB stack (`-Xss1m`). Serving 10,000 connections requires **10 GB of RAM** purely for thread call stacks, before allocating a single application object!
2. **OS Scheduler Collapse:** The Linux kernel CPU scheduler (`CFS` - Completely Fair Scheduler) must context-switch between 10,000 threads. As active connections grow, the CPU spends 90%+ of its time executing thread context switches rather than executing application code. Throughput collapses to zero.

Java 1.4 NIO solved this with **I/O Multiplexing (`java.nio.channels.Selector`)** and non-blocking sockets (`SelectableChannel.configureBlocking(false)`). Instead of allocating one thread per socket, **one single thread** monitors thousands of open sockets simultaneously, waking up only when an OS event (data arrival, connection accepted) occurs.

### Design Pattern Analysis: The Reactor Pattern
Java NIO is the direct foundation for the **Reactor Pattern** (Schmidt, et al.):
1. **Initiation Dispatcher (`Selector`):** Coordinates registration of event handlers and dispatches events.
2. **Demultiplexer (OS Kernel `epoll` / `kqueue`):** Operating system kernel multiplexer that monitors multiple file descriptors.
3. **Event Handlers (`SelectionKey` + callbacks):** Application routines executed in response to specific channel readiness states (`OP_ACCEPT`, `OP_READ`, `OP_WRITE`, `OP_CONNECT`).

# 2. JVM Memory & OS Kernel Interaction (Under the Hood)

### The Evolution of OS I/O Multiplexing: `select` vs `poll` vs `epoll`
How does the operating system know when a socket has data without blocking a thread?

1. **`select(2)` (1983 - BSD Unix):**
   - Developer passes a bitmask array (`fd_set`) of file descriptors to the kernel.
   - **Flaw 1:** Hardcoded limit of 1,024 file descriptors (`FD_SETSIZE`).
   - **Flaw 2:** Every call requires copying the entire bitmask from user space to kernel space. The kernel performs an $O(N)$ linear scan over all 1,024 bits to find which sockets are active.
2. **`poll(2)` (1986 - System V):**
   - Replaced fixed bitmask with an array of `struct pollfd`. Removed the 1,024 limit.
   - **Flaw:** Still requires passing the full array into the kernel and scanning in $O(N)$ time.
3. **`epoll(7)` (2002 - Linux Kernel 2.5.44):**
   - **True $O(1)$ Event Multiplexing!** The kernel maintains an in-memory kernel data structure across calls:
   - `epoll_create1(int flags)`: Allocates an eventpoll instance in kernel RAM.
   - `epoll_ctl(epfd, op, fd, event)`: Adds, modifies, or deletes a file descriptor from the kernel **Red-Black Tree** ($O(\log N)$ registration).
   - `epoll_wait(epfd, events, maxevents, timeout)`: Sleeps the calling thread until an event occurs. When the network interface card (NIC) receives an Ethernet packet, the hardware interrupt invokes the kernel socket callback, which places the ready socket directly into a **Ready Doubly-Linked List**!
   - `epoll_wait()` returns in **$O(1)$ constant time**, returning only the active sockets!

# 3. Step-by-Step State Transitions & Mechanics

### The SelectionKey Bitmask Operations
A channel declares interest in operations using integer bitmasks:
- `SelectionKey.OP_READ` (Binary `00000001` = 1): Socket has data available in kernel receive buffer.
- `SelectionKey.OP_WRITE` (Binary `00000100` = 4): Kernel send buffer has available capacity.
- `SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT` (Binary `00001000` = 8): Outbound TCP handshake finished.
- `SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT` (Binary `00010000` = 16): Listening socket has pending client connection.

### The Fatal Duplicate Event Bug: Why You MUST Call `keyIterator.remove()`
In the NIO event loop:
```java
Set<SelectionKey> selectedKeys = selector.selectedKeys();
Iterator<SelectionKey> it = selectedKeys.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    SelectionKey key = it.next();
    it.remove(); // CRITICAL! NEVER OMIT THIS LINE!
    ...
}
```
**Why this is mandatory:**  
When `selector.select()` finds ready channels, it appends their `SelectionKey`s to the `selectedKeys` set.  
The `Selector` **never removes keys from this set automatically**!  
If you fail to call `it.remove()`, the key remains in the set. On the next iteration of the loop, your code will attempt to process the stale key again, even though no new I/O event occurred for it, causing null reads, busy spinning, or protocol corruption!

### Handling Partial Writes in Non-Blocking Mode
In classic blocking I/O, `out.write(bytes)` blocks the thread until every single byte has been transferred to the kernel buffer.  
In non-blocking NIO:
```java
int bytesWritten = socketChannel.write(buffer);
```
If the OS socket send buffer has only 512 bytes of free space and your buffer contains 4,096 bytes:
- `socketChannel.write()` writes 512 bytes and **returns immediately**.
- `bytesWritten` is 512.
- `buffer.hasRemaining()` is `true` (3,584 bytes unwritten).

**How Production Systems Handle This:**  
1. If `buffer.hasRemaining()`, do **not** block or spin in a `while` loop!
2. Register the channel with the Selector for **`SelectionKey.OP_WRITE`**.
3. When the TCP stack transmits packets and frees socket buffer space, the Selector wakes up with `key.isWritable()`.
4. The thread writes the remaining bytes. Once `buffer.hasRemaining() == false`, the thread **unregisters `OP_WRITE`** to prevent the event loop from firing continuously.

# 6. Top 7 High-Signal Interview Questions & Deep Answers

### Q1: Why is an NIO Selector event loop vulnerable to the "NIO Epoll CPU 100% Bug" (JDK-6403933)?
**Answer:**  
In Linux `epoll`, if a connection is reset abnormally by a peer (`TCP RST`), `epoll_wait()` may return a ready event with an error flag (`POLLHUP` or `POLLERR`), but with zero readable bytes.  
In early OpenJDK versions, `selector.select()` returned immediately with a ready count of 0 or a key with no matching operations. The event loop would immediately call `select()` again, which returned immediately again. This triggered an infinite busy-spin loop, **pinning CPU cores at 100%**.  
**How Netty Solved It:** Netty tracks the number of times `select()` returns consecutively in $< 1$ millisecond. If this count exceeds a threshold (e.g. 512), Netty recreates the `Selector`, migrates all active `SelectionKey` registrations to the new Selector, and discards the corrupted native epoll descriptor.

### Q2: Why is executing a heavy database query or CPU-bound cryptographic task inside a Selector thread considered a fatal architectural flaw?
**Answer:**  
In a single-threaded (or few-threaded) Reactor event loop, that one thread is responsible for dispatching I/O events for **all connected clients** (thousands of sockets).  
If the Selector thread blocks executing a 2-second database query or CPU-heavy task:
- The event loop stops processing events.
- No new TCP connections are accepted (`OP_ACCEPT` stalls).
- All incoming packets buffer up in OS kernel queues and eventually drop.
- From the perspective of all clients, the server is completely unresponsive.  
**Rule:** Event loop threads must **never block**. Heavy CPU or database work must be offloaded to an asynchronous worker thread pool (`ExecutorService`).

### Q3: What is the exact difference between Level-Triggered (LT) and Edge-Triggered (ET) multiplexing?
**Answer:**  
- **Level-Triggered (LT - Default in Java NIO):** `epoll_wait()` notifies you that a file descriptor is ready as long as the condition holds true (e.g., there is at least 1 unread byte in the kernel socket buffer). If you read only half the bytes, `epoll_wait()` will fire again on the next loop.
- **Edge-Triggered (ET):** `epoll_wait()` notifies you **only when the state changes** (e.g., when new data arrives from the network wire). If you read only half the bytes, `epoll_wait()` will **NOT** notify you again until *new* data arrives! If you do not drain the buffer completely in a loop until `EAGAIN` or `EWOULDBLOCK`, your connection will hang indefinitely.

### Q4: Why must a `SelectableChannel` be explicitly configured to non-blocking mode before registering with a Selector?
**Answer:**  
If you attempt to call `channel.register(selector, ops)` on a channel in blocking mode (`channel.isBlocking() == true`), the method immediately throws **`java.nio.channels.IllegalBlockingModeException`**.  
The entire architectural contract of `Selector` is based on non-blocking readiness notifications. If a blocking channel were registered, any subsequent attempt to read or write could block the Selector thread indefinitely, destroying the event multiplexing loop.

### Q5: What is the purpose of `Selector.wakeup()` and how does it work across threads?
**Answer:**  
If a Selector thread is currently blocked inside `selector.select()` waiting for OS events, and another thread needs to register a new channel or change interest ops, `selector.select()` will not return until an OS I/O event occurs.  
`selector.wakeup()` allows another thread to break the Selector out of its blocking `select()` call immediately.  
**Under the Hood:** HotSpot implements `wakeup()` by writing a single dummy byte to an internal loopback pipe or Unix domain socket (`socketpair`) monitored by the epoll set. The kernel detects readability on the internal pipe and unblocks `epoll_wait()`.

### Q6: How does Netty's Multi-Reactor model improve upon the single-threaded Selector architecture?
**Answer:**  
Netty uses the **Multi-Reactor Pattern** (Doug Lea's "Scalable IO in Java"):
1. **`BossGroup` (Acceptor Reactor):** Typically 1 thread running a Selector dedicated exclusively to `OP_ACCEPT` on the `ServerSocketChannel`. It accepts client TCP connections and hands them off.
2. **`WorkerGroup` (Sub-Reactors):** A pool of $2 \times \text{CPU Cores}$ event loops. Each worker manages its own Selector and handles `OP_READ` and `OP_WRITE` for a partition of client sockets.  
This separates connection establishment from data processing, fully utilizing multi-core CPU architectures while preserving lock-free single-threaded processing within each channel pipeline.

### Q7: If a client abruptly terminates (unplugs network cable or kills process), what event does the Selector receive?
**Answer:**  
- **Normal TCP FIN (Graceful Close):** The Selector fires **`OP_READ`**. When `channel.read(buffer)` is invoked, it returns **`-1`** (EOF).
- **Process Abrupt Kill (TCP RST):** The kernel receives a reset packet. The Selector fires **`OP_READ`**. When `channel.read(buffer)` is invoked, it throws **`java.io.IOException: Connection reset by peer`**.  
In both cases, the application must catch this, cancel the key (`key.cancel()`), and close the channel (`channel.close()`) to avoid leaking file descriptors.
